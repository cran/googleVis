The parameters can be set via a named list. The parameters have to map those
of the Google documentation. 
\itemize{
\item{parameters with names that don't include a "." and are set with a single 
value, e.g. width and height. Those are set like one would do in R, that is
\code{options=list(width=200, height=300)}. 
Boolean arguments are set to 
either \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}, using the R syntax.
}
\item{parameters with names that don't include a "."  are set with 
multiple values, e.g. \code{color}, and are wrapped in "[ ]", e.g. 

\code{options=list(colors="['#cbb69d', '#603913', '#c69c6e']")}
}
\item{parameters with names that do include a "." present parameters with 
several sub-options and have to be set as a string wrapped in "{ }".
The values of those sub-options are set via parameter:value. Boolean values
have to be stated as \code{'true'} or \code{'false'}. 
For example the Google documentaion states the formating options for the 
vertical axis and states the parameter as \code{vAxis.format}. 
Then this paramter can be set in R as:

\code{options=list(vAxis="{format:'#,###\%'}")}. 
}
\item{If several sub-options have to be set, e.g. 

\code{titleTextStyle.color}, \code{titleTextStyle.fontName} and 
\code{titleTextStyle.fontSize}, then those can be combined in one list item 
such as:

\code{options=list(titleTextStyle="{color:'red', fontName:'Courier', fontSize:16}")}
}
\item{paramters that can have more than one value per sub-options are 
wrapped in "[ ]". For example to set the labels for left and right axes use:

\code{options=list(vAxes="[{title:'val1'}, {title:'val2'}]")}
}
\item{\code{gvis.editor}}{ a character label for an
 on-page button that opens an in-page dialog box enabling
users to edit, change and customise the chart. By default no
value is given and therefore no button is displayed. 
}
}
